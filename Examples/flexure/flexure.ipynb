    "For flexural isostasy, **Badlands** uses the [**gFlex**](https://github.com/awickert/gFlex) code. This package is designed to solve elastic plate flexure for applications to Earth's lithosphere. For an in-depth understanding of the functionalities of the package, you might want to look at:\n",

    "**Badlands** is designed to compute induced flexural isostasy using **gFlex** 2D finite difference solutions for both constant and arbitrarily varying lithospheric elastic thickness structures. For Badlands, these solutions follow the work of _van Wees et al. (1994)_. In addition Badlands includes the range of implementable boundary conditions from **gFlex**.  \n",

We run 3 tests using a uniform precipitation rate and test the following 3 scenarios:\n",
