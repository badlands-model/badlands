    "The above circular landform is neither a crater nor a volcano, have a look at this [post](http://space.gizmodo.com/this-is-not-a-crater-so-what-is-it-1677228983) for an explanation of its formation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we analyse a **central pit crater** geomorphological evolution over _200k_ years induced by an uniform precipitation (1 m/a). \n",
    "\n",
    "Central pit craters are a crater type that contains an approximately circular depression in their central peak. These craters have been found on _Earth_, _Mars_ or _Ganymede_. Here we use their typical shape to perform a high resolution simulation using Badlands.\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial grid has an approximate resolution of _10_ m and consists of a _2.5_ by _2.5_ km circular crater of _570_ m high with a central pit of _380_ m depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Initial settings\n",
    "\n",
    "For this model, we use the *stream power law sediment transport model* which scale the incision rate $E$ as a power function of surface water discharge $A$ and slope $S=\\nabla z$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ E = \\kappa A^m (\\nabla z)^n$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\kappa$ is the erodibility coefficient dependent on lithology and mean precipitation rate, channel width, flood frequency, channel hydraulics.\n",

    "### Depression filling method\n",
    "\n",
    "To handle depression there are 2 available options in **Badlands**. The first one consists in using a modified version of Planchon & Darboux depression-filling algorithm. In this approach the time step is automatically adjust in order to ensure stability and to prevent formation of depositional mount. The method consists in filling depressions with lakes of user-imposed maximum depth (parameter **fillmax**) and simulating the filling of the lake as an iterative process. The approach conserves mass but will force the model to use small time steps for large depression area.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gaussian filtering method\n",
    "\n",
    "The second approach which is used in this example, consists in forcing the time step (parameter **gtime**) and  applying for each iteration a smoothing algorithm on obtained erosion/deposition thicknesses (Gaussian filter with specific standard deviation kernel). Therefore the method will not conserve the mass but will give an approximate representation of the erosional/depositional patterns developping over geological time scales. The resulting model will run faster than with the depression-filling method. It is a good alternative to the first approach when one wants to understand trends in erosional and depositional patterns in active tectonic settings.\n",
