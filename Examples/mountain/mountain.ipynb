    "We investigate the drainage network dynamics and the steady-state fluvial patterns that emerge from an application of these climatic forcing mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first part of the scenario starts from a flat topography subjected to a constant and uniform rate of tectonic rock uplift (>1 mm/a) and precipitation (1 m/a). The domain is rectangular and the four edges are kept at a constant base-level elevation. The area is a 40x80 km domain. \n",
    "\n",
    "After 8 Ma, the second scenario is applied and consists in a linearly varying rainfall pattern corresponding to an orographic precipitation with the same uniform tectonic uplift rate. The Northern part of the domain is experiencing a 2 m/a precipitation rate and the Southern part is subject to a 0.1 m/a precipitation rate for the next 12 Ma. \n",

    "\n",
    "$$ E = \\kappa A^m (\\nabla z)^n$$\n",
    "\n",
