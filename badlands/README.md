Basin and Landscape Dynamics (Badlands) is a long-term surface evolution model built to simulate landscape development, sediment transport and sedimentary basins formation from upstream regions down to marine environments.

## What’s in the box?

Badlands is an open-source Python-based code and can be used to simulate:

+ hillslope processes (linear & non-linear diffusion),
+ fluvial incision (Stream Power Law, Transport Capacity Law)
+ sediment transport and deposition,
+ wave-induced longshore drift transport,
+ reef growth and carbonate platform formation,
+ submarine gravity currents (turbidity currents),
+ spatially and temporally varying tectonic (horizontal + vertical displacements) and
+ effects of climate changes (rainfall) and/or sea-level fluctuations.
